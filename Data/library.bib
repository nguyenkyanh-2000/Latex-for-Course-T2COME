abstract = {Background: With excellent shape memory and superelastic properties, shape memory alloy (SMA) is an ideal actuator, and it can form smart structure for different applications in medical field. However, SMA devices cause apparent thermal damage to the surrounding tissues when it works in vivo, making the application of smart structure that is composed of SMA actuator in vivo is greatly limited. Methods: In this paper, coating (APA) with PLA as the main body to limit the heat conduction, a multifunctional Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs)/polylactic acid (PLA)/Al2O3 was synthesized. The Al2O3 layer was formed by micro-arc oxidation (MAO) and AgNPs were synthesized by silver nitrate and ethylene glycol. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscope, and Fourier transform infrared spectra were applied to analyze the morphology and characterization of APA coating. The antimicrobial activity, thermal insulation activity, and biocompatibility of APA coating were furtherly explored and verified through animal experiments and immunohistochemistry. Results: With different particle sizes and concentrations of AgNPs, APA multi-functional films were successfully prepared. The Al2O3 layer was closely combined with SMA and formed a porous surface, so the PLA and AgNPs layers can firmly adhere to SMA, thus reducing the release of nickel ions in SMA. AgNPs gave APA coating excellent antibacterial activity and effectively inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, coupled with the low thermal conductivity of PLA and Al2O3, AgNPs were tightly anchored on the surface of PLA, which has high infrared reflectivity, making the APA coating obtain good thermal insulation performance. Conclusion: We have successfully prepared the APA coating and obtained the optimum amount of AgNPs, which makes it have good thermal insulation performance, good antibacterial activity and good biocompatibility, which provides a new prospect for the application of SMA.},

@article{Brown2008,
abstract = {Hot beverages such as tea, hot chocolate, and coffee are frequently served at  temperatures between 160 degrees F (71.1 degrees C) and 185 degrees F (85 degrees C). Brief exposures to liquids in this temperature range can cause significant scald burns. However, hot beverages must be served at a temperature that is high enough to provide a satisfactory sensation to the consumer. This paper presents an analysis to quantify hot beverage temperatures that balance limiting the potential scald burn hazard and maintaining an acceptable perception of adequate product warmth. A figure of merit that can be optimized is defined that quantifies and combines both the above effects as a function of the beverage temperature. An established mathematical model for simulating burns as a function of applied surface temperature and time of exposure is used to quantify the extent of thermal injury. Recent data from the literature defines the consumer preferred drinking temperature of coffee. A metric accommodates the thermal effects of both scald hazard and product taste to identify an optimal recommended serving temperature. The burn model shows the standard exponential dependence of injury level on temperature. The preferred drinking temperature of coffee is specified in the literature as 140+/-15 degrees F (60+/-8.3 degrees C) for a population of 300 subjects. A linear (with respect to temperature) figure of merit merged the two effects to identify an optimal drinking temperature of approximately 136 degrees F (57.8 degrees C). The analysis points to a reduction in the presently recommended serving temperature of coffee to achieve the combined result of reducing the scald burn hazard and improving customer satisfaction.},

abstract = {Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

@article{Bailey2008,
abstract = {Aluminum beer bottles recently have been introduced as an alternative to traditional glass bottles or aluminum cans. Advertisements claim that the new aluminum bottles keep beer "colder longer" than glass bottles. Because the thermal conductivity of aluminum is over 150 times that of typical soda-lime glass, and because the bottle wall is thinner, this claim appears counterintuitive. In this investigation, the thermal performance of commercially available aluminum and glass beer bottles was examined using experimental, analytical, and computational methods. It was found that when exposed to ambient air, glass and aluminum bottles perform in a nearly identical manner with respect to keeping their contents cold. Each bottle showed an approximately 15C temperature rise over a 2.7-hour period. Heat transfer is controlled by natural convection and thermal radiation at the outer bottle surface; hence, the difference in thermal conductivity between the bottles has no significant impact on the temperature transient. Computational simulations also predict that when an aluminum bottle is immersed in an ice-water bath, the liquid cools more quickly than in glass due to the lower thermal resistance of the aluminum versus the glass; when held in the hand, the glass bottle allows the liquid to warm more slowly than the aluminum bottle.},

abstract = {Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world, prepared and consumed in  many different ways. Taste, aroma and composition of the coffee brew vary depending on the preparation method. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of different brewing methods on the polyphenol and methylxanthine composition and antioxidant capacity of thirteen different coffee brews. The content of total phenols and flavonoids was determined spectrophotometrically and the content of chlorogenic acid derivates (3-CQA, 4-CQA and 5-CQA) and caffeine using the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-PDA). Antioxidant capacity of coffee brews was evaluated by using the ABTS (2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) and FRAP (ferric-reducing antioxidant power) assays. Instant coffee brews showed the highest values in content of total phenols, chlorogenic acid derivates, caffeine and antioxidant capacity, which significantly decreased by milk addition. The antioxidant capacity of coffee brews was in compliance with the total phenol content and content of chlorogenic acid derivates.},
